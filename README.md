## Description
  This application is a proof of concept for me for MVC methods, and heroku deployment with mysql. The app is very simple and allows you to add names of types of burgers that you can eat, Delete them, and update the from devoured to not devoured. It is created using Node.js, npm express, mysql, and Heroku. The program is run via the browser and takes user input as well as button clicks.
